        <h3>Trying something new.</h3>
        <p>
          Most "residents" of prisons have never even tried to paint or sculpt, or work with thier hands in a positve way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getiing involved with Art, shows these people they can do more then break the law or be violent, they see they can create something new.
        </p>
        <p>
          For alot of people this is the first time they have been involved in something constructive and positive.

        <h3>Point of pride</h3>
        <p>
          Seeing that they can do more then they were likely told growing up, leads residents to believe that putting in the energy for something new wont be in vain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The feeling of accomplishment, for some, can/will lead to finishing school. For some it could be getting a high school diploma or G.E.D. and for anyone that has that already, college becomes the plan.

People in prison who earn an associate's degree are around 85% less likely to return to prison, while those who receive a bachelor's degree are more than 95% less likely. (Google-Apr 12, 2023)
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Considering the fact that the last study, wich finshed in 2023, Shows that 82% of People released from prison are rearrested within ten years. Its basic math, or maybe the people in power prefer to continue with mass incarceration...

      Pursuit of Other Educational and Vocational Programs.
      <br>
      Researchers have found a strong correlation between arts education and practice, 
      and the pursuit of knowledge through other educational and vocational programs. 
      Arts and the creative process help to develop the "right brain", and to build 
      confidence and self-esteem, all of which prepares and encourages individuals to 
      expand their learning in other disciplines. Studies have shown this relationship is 
      particularly powerful for those who are alienated from the formal education 
      system--often the case with inmates. As we previously reported, prison arts 
      programs have served as a gateway to further learning.
      Participants were asked if they had enrolled in other educational or vocational 
      programs. We then controlled for those who had studied or practiced art and those 
      who hadn't. Table 13 shows that those with previous art experience are more likely 
      to pursue other educational opportunities either currently (37%) or have pursued 
      educational opportunities in the past (57%) than those who haven't studied or 
      practiced art (27% and 30%) respectively. Further, those who pursued educational
      opportunities in the past (83%) or currently (78%) are more likely to have had past 
      art experience than are those who report not having pursued educational 
      opportunities (28%). These results are statistically significant with a Chi-square = 
      21.866, df=2, p<,001.
